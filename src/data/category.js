      "Whether you work in machine learning or finance, or are pursuing a career in web development or data science, Python is one of the most important skills you can learn. Python's simple syntax is especially suited for desktop, web, and business applications. Python's design philosophy emphasizes readability and usability. Python was developed upon the premise that there should be only one way (and preferably one obvious way) to do things, a philosophy that has resulted in a strict level of code standardization. The core programming language is quite small and the standard library is also large. In fact, Python's large library is one of its greatest benefits, providing a variety of different tools for programmers suited for many different tasks.",

      "Regardless of the industry you work in, Microsoft Office Excel is an invaluable spreadsheet program for organizing and representing data. Excel offers functions, formulas, and pivot tables to help you aggregate and then analyze large sets of information. Excel first truly appeared on the scene way back in 1987, when a version was released for Windows. Excel is a complex and powerful software today, and it gives you a great degree of control over the data in your spreadsheet. Yet, it's easy for even beginners to learn it.",

    description:
      "JavaScript is one of the most ubiquitous programming languages on the planet, mostly because it's the backbone of interactive web applications. On top of that, JavaScript is a great language for beginners because it gives them a chance to write code that does something visual, which is exciting and helpful when you're just getting started as a programmer. Dynamic content is the hot topic in web development right now. Dynamic content refers to content that constantly changes and adapts to specific users whenever possible. For example, JavaScript can be used to determine if a website visitor is using a computer or a mobile device before deciding whether or not to render the mobile version of the website. It's these small things behind the scenes that create genuine value in using JavaScript to create dynamic web pages.",
